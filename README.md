# JetEngineCycleSimulator ✈️🔥

A Python-based simulation tool to model and analyze jet engine thermodynamic cycles.  
This project aims to assist in the study of propulsion systems by simulating various engine types and their performance.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates ideal Brayton cycle
- Calculates thermal efficiency, pressure ratio, and specific thrust
- Modular structure for adding different jet engine types (Turbojet, Turbofan, etc.)
- Easy-to-modify input parameters for quick experimentation

## 🛠️ Requirements

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
